# Customized and Responsive Jupyter Notebook
<br><br>

This endeavor shows how to customize Jupyter Notebooks using HTML & CSS and enhance their look and feel.
Customizing them into a more personalized and visually appealing format certainly brings unique experience. 
Integrating HTML and CSS in notebooks not only enhances the look but also make them responsive if intended to 
use them as web pages. This approach allows for greater control over the presentation of content, making your notebooks 
not only more functional but also more engaging. For example, you can view one of my projects completely developed in 
Jupyter Notebook -
